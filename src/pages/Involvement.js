        <p className="TextTitle">Education</p>
        <p className="TextDetail">Once accepted to TAMID Group, new members go through an 8-week education program that prepares them to contribute to a consulting or investing team. With an emphasis on practical, experiential learning, the education program is hardly like sitting in a classroom and listening to a lecture. New members are challenged on a weekly basis in workshops and competitions, as they delve into a variety of fields within consulting, investing, and entrepreneurship. All business topics are taught through the lens of Israeli case studies. In addition, new members explore the exciting startup universe in Israel.</p>

        <p className="TextTitle">Consulting</p>
        <p className="TextDetail">TAMID Group Consulting provides pro-bono advisory services for the most exciting and innovative companies coming out of Israel.

Market Analysis,

        <p className="TextTitle">Investing</p>
        <p className="TextDetail">Did you know that Israel—the 153rd largest country in the world by landmass—is home to the 3rd most companies traded on the Nasdaq?



The TAMID Investment Fund enables members to conduct due-diligence on Israeli stocks and manage a live portfolio. Each chapter competes in an organization-wide trading competition, giving each member’s research a national impact. TAMID expects Investment Fund leaders to facilitate ongoing financial education, with guidance from faculty and professional investors.



Beyond the competition, TAMID offers partnership opportunities with the financial media outlet Seeking Alpha. Some chapters are even raising money for a modest real-life portfolio.



Ultimately, TAMID offers students the edge they need to break into the hyper-competitive financial services industry.</p>

        <p className="TextTitle">Fellowship</p>
        <p className="TextDetail">Produced in partnership with Onward Israel, the TAMID Group Fellowship is a competitive, 8-week summer internship program that provides outstanding TAMID Group leaders with the opportunity to work with host companies in Israel while living in Tel Aviv.
